## Credits
The original Shelf-Life was a collaborative project built by [Jose Diaz](https://github.com/hotsoup42), [Jeff Lynch](https://github.com/kingami34), and me, [William Crownover](https://github.com/WilliamCrownover).

The starting code for this repo comes from the collaborative version of Shelf-Life.

The original repo for Shelf-Life can be found here: https://github.com/WilliamCrownover/shelf-life

## Description
This full-stack web app helps user’s keep track of their grocery’s expiration dates in order to help them save food and money. The app allows new user’s to create a validated account and save grocery item details to a pantry list so that they can return to their saved pantry anytime, anywhere. With the stored expiration dates, the app refreshes the lists to show what has expired, what needs to be used this week, needs to be used this month, or is in no rush to be consumed. After an item is used up the user can delete the product off the list to keep their shelves nice and organized.
