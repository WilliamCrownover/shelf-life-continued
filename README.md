## Credits
The original Shelf-Life was a collaborative project built by [Jose Diaz](https://github.com/hotsoup42), [Jeff Lynch](https://github.com/kingami34), and me, [William Crownover](https://github.com/WilliamCrownover).

The starting code for this repo comes from the collaborative version of Shelf-Life.

## Description
My continued development of the collaborative project Shelf-Life, a web app designed to help keep track of grocery's expiration dates.
